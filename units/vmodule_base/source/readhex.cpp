changed: do not write binary to file, instead, return buffer

usage: int readhex(char *mcsfilename,unsigned char * binbuf,size_t bufsize);
if return value ==0 binbuf contains binary verion of hex file

 * 386hex2bin is used for format HEX386 to BIN(binary) written by Wei Wei in
 * ShangHai. Please email comments, suggestions, bugs to cortex-a8@163.com .

 * Wei Wei is a firm software engineer on 8051, MIPS, ARM7 and ARM9. Now he is
 * applying himself to researching cortex-a8 which is a branch of ARM. He is
 * an expert on U-boot and Linux 2.6.

 * The Intel HEX file is an ASCII text file with lines of text that
 * follow the Intel HEX file format. Each line in an Intel HEX file
 * contains one HEX record. These records are made up of hexadecimal
 * numbers that represent machine language code and/or constant data.
 * Intel HEX files are often used to transfer the program and data that
 * would be stored in a ROM or EPROM. Most EPROM programmers or emulators
 * can use Intel HEX files.
 *
 * Extended Linear Address Records (HEX386)
 *
 * Extended linear address records are also known as 32-bit address
 * records and HEX386 records. These records contain the upper 16 bits
 * (bits 16-31) of the data address. The extended linear address record
 * always has two data bytes and appears as follows:
 *  :02000004FFFFFC
 *  where:
 * 02 is the number of data bytes in the record.
 * 0000 is the address field. For the extended linear address record,
 *  this field is always 0000.
 * 04 is the record type 04 (an extended linear address record).
 * FFFF is the upper 16 bits of the address.
 * FC is the checksum of the record and is calculated as
 *      01h + NOT(02h + 00h + 00h + 04h + FFh + FFh).

 * More detail about HEX386 see http://www.keil.com/support/docs/1584.htm

 * The function of this code is
 * This code is free. You can use it for commercial purposes, and you can aslo
 * improve it in any way.
